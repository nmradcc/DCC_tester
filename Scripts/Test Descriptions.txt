1. RunPacketAcceptanceTest

This test runs with standard packet timing values of:
Preamble bits = 17
DCC bit one duration = 58
DCC bit zero duration = 100

Default user options are:
address=3
inter_packet_delay_ms=1000
pass_count=10
# logging_level 0=none 1=minimal 2=verbose
logging_level=1
stop_on_failure=false
serial_port=COM6
in_circuit_motor=false

The test can be run with or without the motor in circuit.
The Pass/Fail critera is slightly different depending on in_circuit_motor selection.

The test involves starting the locomotive decoder to 1/2 speed reverse,
waiting a delay then sending an Emergency Stop command. Checks are made
throughout to verify the decoder received and operated on the commands.

With in_circuit_motor=true current feedback is used. The baseline off current is
initially measured then again when running and when stopped.
The pass critera inforces the current increased when started and decreased back to baseline
off when stopped.

With in_circuit_motor=false voltage feedback is used. The M+ and M- motor
leads are sensed via optocoupled logic inputs. Again the logic is sampled throughout
and similar Pass/Fail logic is used.
